Build a Node.js (TypeScript) project that relays Minecraft Bedrock (vanilla BDS) chat ↔ a Discord channel.

Key decisions:
- Use discord.js v14 for Discord.
- Use bedrock-protocol ONLY to connect to the Bedrock server as a listener client and capture inbound chat + presence signals.
- Do NOT send chat into the game via bedrock-protocol.
- For Discord → Minecraft, write to the Bedrock Dedicated Server STDIN via: pm2 send <processNameOrId> <argv...>.

Project requirements:
- Single encrypted JSON config file on disk (AES-256-GCM; password-based key via scrypt). Provide CLI to encrypt/validate config and prompt for password at runtime.
- Robust loop prevention (marker + hash TTL LRU).
- Rate limiting per direction (token bucket).
- Message sanitization (strip MC (§_) formatting codes; resolve mentions/roles; collapse newlines).
- Message splitting for Minecraft max length.
- Robust player roster/presence tracking (player add/remove packets + heuristics + optional /list reconciliation via stdin when needed).
- Reconnect/backoff with jitter for the bedrock-protocol listener.
- Slash commands: /status, /reconnect (admin-only), /list, /kick (admin-only), /restart (admin-only)

Repo includes high-quality README.md, see AGENTS.md for detailed spec, structure, tests, and security constraints. Implement tests for all pure logic and presence state machine.

Deliver a production-ready repo: clean module structure, typed config schema, structured logging, and SOLID design principles.
